Description: Brute Force vs Mergesort to find inversions

To compile, first type "make clean" to ensure everything is cleaned.
Then type "make" to compile two executables.
To run question 1.3, type: ./p1
To run question 2.3, type: ./p2 

design.pdf includes the algorithms (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2)

Comparison between 1.1 and 1.2:
On average, 1.1 takes 5.87 seconds whereas 1.2 takes 0.005 seconds. The divide-and-conquer algorithm is significantly faster, approximately 1174 times faster.

Comparison between 2.1 and 2.2:
On average, 2.1 takes 22.8 seconds to run, whereas 2.2 takes roughly 0.02 seconds (including sorting all x-coordinates). This is a significant difference since the max value for this situation was 30000, there was a distinct run time difference.
